# Just a wordpress plugin with assorted functionality
Extra bootstrapping for wordpress projects(which require some OO mapping and other common functions). Works alongside ACF, some extra gizmos for customising the back end for administrators, and functions to help make more complicated templating simple.


I'm fairly sure this wouldn't save anyone time aside myself however.

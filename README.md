# Just a wordpress plugin with assorted functionality
Extra bootstrapping for wordpress projects(which require some OO mapping and other common functions). Works alongside ACF.


I'm fairly sure this wouldn't save anyone time aside myself however.

Note;

Includes the PHP dompdf library (LGPL : https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf)
